Q&A Lite
========

- A basic Questions and Answers board that you can embed

### Features So Far

- Quick Reply a.k.a instant answer: Answer a question without having to read the full description
- Question Tagging: Pretty self explanatory...
- Search by Question
- Search by Answer
- Browse by Tag
- Profiles: This will probably be replaced see the future list for more info

### Future Versions

- Profile pics: Upload your own or use a third party
- Pagination: This is pretty much required.
- Auto-Tagging of Questions: Sounds cool(for lazy folks) but not quite sure if actually useful
- U.I: Visual tweaks will always be added until I'm satisfied with the overall look
- Official Answers: Allow the owner of a question to choose the correct answer
- Question Sorting and Ranking: Sort Questions by views and or most answers
- Community Answer: Perhaps the owner of the original question had bad taste; so let the community pick the best answer
- Add Users From Existing MySQL: Most PHP sites use MySQL, thus user profiles need to be transferred, or just use MySQL for Auth
- Admin Console: If I ever get to this point, an Admin console will be the **last** feature

### Tech Info
